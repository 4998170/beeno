* Implement some form of proxying for retrieved entity instances (possibly using cglib?) -- 
  this would allow watching matched properties for changes so that we can properly 
  synchronize the stored values
  
* HUtil pool configuration is static and all hard-coded.  This sucks.

* Need unit tests.  Can start with some meetup db tests, but need to
  be able to bootstrap and run them.

* For query scanning of secondary index tables, should maybe use row
  prefix filters instead of value filters
